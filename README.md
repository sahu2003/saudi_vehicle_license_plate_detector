## Saudi Arabia License Plate Detector

This project utilizes a YOLOv8n-based model, meticulously trained on Saudi Arabia's license plates for over 200 epochs, to achieve high accuracy in detection. The model not only identifies the license plates but also employs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to read the text on them.

### Key Features:
- **YOLOv8n Base Model**: Leveraging the latest in YOLO architecture for efficient and accurate object detection.
- **Extensive Training**: The model has been trained for more than 200 epochs specifically on images of Saudi Arabian license plates, ensuring robustness and precision.
- **OCR Integration**: After detecting the license plates, OCR technology is used to extract and read the text.
- **Arabic Text Handling**: The BiDi algorithm is implemented to correctly handle and annotate Arabic text on the images, maintaining the correct text direction and formatting.

### Contents:
- **Trained YOLOv8n Model**: Pre-trained weights and configuration files.
- **Python Script**: Code for running the detection and OCR processes.
